Very helpful docs! Especially the stuff on the low level design and rationale
for 'object oriented' style c. Notes below from python 3.6 on ubuntu 16.10
using commit 36779a8.

1. the python install instructions worked fine for me (following the
instructions to install sys reqs, using `pip install .` and `pip install -r
requirements.txt`)

2. nosetests gave some failures without numpy and h5py installed (noted in PR)

3. running `make` in the `lib` directory worked to build the c cli

4. after install, running `msp` or `mspms` from the command line gave me an
error `pkg_resources.DistributionNotFound: The 'svgwrite' distribution was not
found and is required by msprime` is there some additional sysreq for svgwrite?
It appears with `pip freeze` and I can load it fine in python.

5. I didn't try to run `python verification.py` as I hadn't installed for
python2

6. I got a recursion depth error trying to build the docs:

sphinx-build -b html -d _build/doctrees  -W . _build/html
Running Sphinx v1.5.3

Recursion error:
maximum recursion depth exceeded while calling a Python object

This can happen with very large or deeply nested source files.  You can
carefully increase the default Python recursion limit of 1000 in conf.py with
e.g.:
    import sys; sys.setrecursionlimit(1500)
    Makefile:57: recipe for target 'html' failed
    make: *** [html] Error 1
