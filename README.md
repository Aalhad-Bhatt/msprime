``msprime`` is a population genetics simulator
based on [tskit](https://tskit.dev). Msprime can simulate random
ancestral histories for a sample of individuals
(consistent with a given demographic model) under a
range of different models and evolutionary processes. Msprime can
also simulate mutations on a given ancestral
history (which can be produced by msprime ancestry simulations
or other programs supporting [tskit](https://tskit.dev)) under
a variety of different models of genome sequence evolution.
